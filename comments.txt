sans serif font for navbar
No zoom in on logo on hover

Audio color no contrast
Description change for more contrast
See all same sans serif, larger, maybe button ish, no reaction on hover

Remove words from logos
Make separate sections for donation and sponsors
Make design flexible for multiple logos

Put padding on footer, and same sans serif for text in footer
Add "Developed by the Computer Society of the Ateneo" to the footer na medyo more noticeable

Maybe for navbar and footer we can have a background color, similar to what github does na same color navbar and footer (black)

You said you had ideas for the sections color, can you disregard the exact colors Tasyo provided and go for what you think looks good please
